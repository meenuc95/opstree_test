## Introduction

This document is a comprehensive guide to managing **microrepos** — a repository strategy where each microservice or component is maintained in its own separate repository. In a microrepo setup, ideally, each repository contains the code for a single service, promoting isolation and independence.

By reading this document, users will gain a clear understanding of  benefits, challenges, workflows, and best practices of microrepos and how to  set up and manage them effectively.

---

## Purpose

The primary primary of using microrepos is to support independent development and deployment. Instead of having a single monolithic repository for all services (a monorepo), microrepos allow each service to manage its own development lifecycle, including tooling, testing, and release processes.

This is particularly useful in larger teams or systems where decoupling is important — teams don't have to coordinate every small change, and services can be built or deployed independently.

---

## Why We Choose Microrepos

Isolation: Each repository is independent, which can reduce the chance of unwanted interactions between parts of our system.

Scalability: Microrepos can scale more easily since each repository has its own build and test times.

Autonomy: Different teams can have more control over their own codebases, which can make it easier to make decisions and iterate quickly.

Clear Ownership: Each repository has a clear owner, which can make it easier to assign responsibility and accountability.
Improve CI/CD performance: Smaller repositories are quicker to test and deploy.

---

## Advantages



Advantages of microrepository management
Enhanced Isolation and Reduced Risk: Changes within one microrepository have limited impact on others, reducing the risk of introducing bugs or breaking functionality across the entire system.
Improved Scalability and Faster Release Cycles: Each microrepository can be scaled, updated, or rolled back independently, leading to faster release cycles and improved system resilience.
Clear Ownership : Each repository has a defined owner or team responsible for its maintenance and development
Faster builds: No need to build or test unrelated code.
Cleaner collaboration: Fewer conflicts, clearer pull requests.


---

## Disadvantages
Increased Complexity: Managing multiple repositories can lead to higher overhead in terms of tooling, configuration, and coordination between teams.
Dependency Management Complexity: Managing dependencies across multiple repositories requires careful version tracking and coordination to ensure compatibility.
Code Duplication: Coordinating changes across multiple repositories can be more challenging, potentially leading to code duplication.
Dependency duplication: Each microservice typically has its own set of dependencies. With Microrepos, there is a possibility of duplicated dependencies across different repositories. This can result in increased storage requirements and potential difficulties in managing and updating dependencies consistently.
Deployment and testing overhead: Deploying and testing multiple microservices individually can be more time-consuming and resource-intensive compared to a monolithic deployment. Ensuring the compatibility and integration of all services during the deployment process may require additional effort and thorough testing procedures.

## Best Practices
Maintain Consistent Repository Structure: Standardize folder structures across repositories to facilitate onboarding and code navigation.
Use Clear Naming Conventions: Adopt descriptive naming conventions for repositories that reflect their purpose clearly.
Include Comprehensive Documentation: Provide detailed documentation within each repository covering setup instructions, dependencies, APIs, and deployment guidelines.
Automated Testing:
Implement robust automated testing within each micro-repo to ensure the quality and reliability of individual services
