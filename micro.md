## Introduction

This document is a comprehensive guide to managing **microrepos** — a repository strategy where each microservice or component is maintained in its own separate repository. In a microrepo setup, ideally, each repository contains the code for a single service, promoting isolation and independence.

By reading this document, users will gain a clear understanding of  benefits, challenges, workflows, and best practices of microrepos and how to  set up and manage them effectively.

---

## Purpose

The primary primary of using microrepos is to support independent development and deployment. Instead of having a single monolithic repository for all services (a monorepo), microrepos allow each service to manage its own development lifecycle, including tooling, testing, and release processes.

This is particularly useful in larger teams or systems where decoupling is important — teams don't have to coordinate every small change, and services can be built or deployed independently.

---

## Why We Choose Microrepos

Isolation: Each repository is independent, which can reduce the chance of unwanted interactions between parts of our system.

Scalability: Microrepos can scale more easily since each repository has its own build and test times.

Autonomy: Different teams can have more control over their own codebases, which can make it easier to make decisions and iterate quickly.

Clear Ownership: Each repository has a clear owner, which can make it easier to assign responsibility and accountability.
Improve CI/CD performance: Smaller repositories are quicker to test and deploy.

## Advantages



Advantages of microrepository management
Enhanced Isolation and Reduced Risk: Changes within one microrepository have limited impact on others, reducing the risk of introducing bugs or breaking functionality across the entire system.
Improved Scalability and Faster Release Cycles: Each microrepository can be scaled, updated, or rolled back independently, leading to faster release cycles and improved system resilience.
Clear Ownership : Each repository has a defined owner or team responsible for its maintenance and development
Faster builds: No need to build or test unrelated code.
Cleaner collaboration: Fewer conflicts, clearer pull requests.
