## Introduction

This document is a comprehensive guide to managing **microrepos** — a repository strategy where each microservice or component is maintained in its own separate repository. In a microrepo setup, ideally, each repository contains the code for a single service, promoting isolation and independence.

By reading this document, users will gain a clear understanding of  benefits, challenges, workflows, and best practices of microrepos and how to  set up and manage them effectively.

## What is Microrepo

A **Microrepo** (short for microrepository) is a repository model where each service or component is maintained in its own separate Git repository—unlike a monorepo, where all code lives in a single repository.

The primary purpose of using microrepos is to support **independent development, testing, and deployment** of services. Each repository can define its own tooling, workflows, CI/CD pipelines, and release strategies.

This approach is especially useful in large-scale systems or teams that require **decoupling**. Teams can work autonomously, avoid unnecessary coordination for unrelated changes, and release features faster and with less risk.

## Why Microrepo

As systems grow, having everything in a single repository (monorepo) can become difficult to manage. Build times increase, pull requests take longer to review, and small changes in one service can accidentally affect others.

Microrepos address these challenges with the following features:

| Feature                     | Description                                                                                         |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Isolation                  | Each repository is independent, reducing the risk of unintended interactions across the system.     |
| Scalability                | Repositories can scale more easily, as each has its own build and test lifecycle.                   |
| Autonomy                   | Teams have full control over their own codebases, enabling faster decision-making and iteration.     |
| Clear Ownership            | Defined ownership per repository makes responsibility and maintenance more manageable.              |
| Improved CI/CD Performance | Smaller codebases result in quicker testing and deployments, enhancing pipeline performance.         |

## Advantages of Microrepository Management

| Advantage                          | Description                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enhanced Isolation & Reduced Risk | Changes in one microrepository have limited impact, reducing bugs and preventing system-wide breakages.       |
| Improved Scalability & Release    | Repositories can be independently scaled, updated, or rolled back, enabling faster release cycles.             |
| Clear Ownership                   | Each repository has a defined owner or team responsible for its maintenance and development.                   |
| Faster Builds                     | Only relevant code is built and tested, improving CI performance.                                             |
| Cleaner Collaboration             | Fewer merge conflicts and clearer pull requests lead to more efficient teamwork.                              |

## Disadvantages of Microrepository Management

| Disadvantage                    | Description                                                                                                                        |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Increased Complexity           | Managing multiple repositories adds overhead in tooling, configuration, and team coordination.                                    |
| Dependency Management          | Requires careful versioning and coordination to maintain compatibility across services.                                           |
| Code Duplication               | Similar logic may be repeated across repositories due to isolated codebases.                                                       |
| Dependency Duplication         | Repositories may include redundant dependencies, increasing storage usage and complicating updates.                               |
| Deployment & Testing Overhead  | Deploying and testing multiple services separately increases time and requires robust integration testing and orchestration.

## Microrepo Workflow
A microrepository workflow enables teams to independently develop, test, and deploy their respective services while maintaining consistency and coordination across the system.

### 1. Set Up the Repository
Each microservice gets its own Git repository. Teams usually follow a consistent folder structure and naming convention to keep things organized. Essential files like README.md, .gitignore, and CI/CD configs are added at this stage.

### 2. Start Development
Developers clone only the repo they need and work on feature branches. Since each service is isolated, teams can move quickly without worrying about unrelated parts of the system.

### 3. Write and Run Tests
Tests are written alongside the code — this includes unit tests, integration tests, or both. Every time code is pushed, automated tests are triggered through the repo’s CI pipeline.

### 4. Submit Code for Review
Once a feature or fix is ready, a pull request is opened. Teammates review the changes, suggest improvements if needed, and then approve the merge into the main branch.

### 5. Build and Deploy
When changes are merged, the CI/CD pipeline handles the build and deployment process. Since each service is deployed independently, releases are more frequent and less risky.

### 6. Monitor and Maintain
After deployment, each service is monitored individually for performance, errors, and reliability. Any issues can be addressed directly within the relevant repo.

### 7. Coordinate When Needed
For changes that impact multiple services — like shared contracts or cross-cutting features — teams plan together and communicate clearly to stay in sync.


## Best Practices

- **Maintain Consistent Repository Structure**: Standardize folder structures across all microrepositories to simplify onboarding and improve code navigation.

- **Use Clear Naming Conventions**: Adopt descriptive and consistent naming patterns for repositories to clearly reflect their purpose and functionality.

- **Include Comprehensive Documentation**: Each repository should contain a detailed README that covers setup instructions, dependencies, API usage, and deployment guidelines.

- **Implement Automated Testing**: Integrate robust automated tests within each microrepository to ensure the quality, stability, and reliability of services.




## Conclusion

Microrepos offer a scalable and modular approach to managing codebases, particularly in systems composed of multiple services and teams. By supporting independent development, testing, and deployment, they enhance team autonomy, streamline build and release processes, and ensure clear code ownership.

Although microrepos come with challenges like increased coordination and dependency management, these can be effectively managed through automation and well-defined best practices—enabling teams to fully realize the benefits of this architecture.
